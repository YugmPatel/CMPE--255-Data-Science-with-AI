# README - Kaggle House Prices Prediction Project (Assignment 1)

## Overview

This project involves using the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to predict house prices using the **Kaggle House Prices dataset**. The process was performed using ChatGPT's code interpreter to guide through various stages of a typical data science project, including data exploration, preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

The main goal was to predict house prices based on different features, such as square footage, location, and quality of construction, using several machine learning models.

## Project Outline

### 1. Business Understanding
   - Define the business problem: Predict house prices based on available features.
   - Objective: Develop a predictive model and determine which features most influence house prices.

### 2. Data Understanding
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Assess data quality: Identify missing values, outliers, and data types.

### 3. Data Preparation
   - Clean the data: Handle missing values, outliers, and prepare features.
   - Feature selection: Use correlation analysis to identify the most predictive features.
   - Data preprocessing: Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.

### 4. Modeling
   - Build a baseline model (Linear Regression) and advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Compare model performance using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.
   - Evaluate feature importance for insights into key house price drivers.

### 5. Evaluation
   - Analyze model performance and interpret results.
   - Check for overfitting and refine the model if necessary.

### 6. Deployment
   - Provide recommendations based on the best-performing model.
   - Discuss future steps, such as hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
