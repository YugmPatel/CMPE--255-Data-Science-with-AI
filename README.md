# CMPE--255-Data-Science-with-AI 


## Overview

This project involves using the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to predict house prices using the **Kaggle House Prices dataset**. The process was performed using ChatGPT's code interpreter to guide through various stages of a typical data science project, including data exploration, preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

The main goal was to predict house prices based on different features, such as square footage, location, and quality of construction, using several machine learning models.

## Project Files

- **Colab Notebook**: The main code used in the project, written in Python. [Download the Colab notebook](sandbox:/mnt/data/House_Prices_Prediction_Project.ipynb)
- **Chat Transcript**: The exported transcript of the conversation where code and explanations were generated using ChatGPT (you need to export it from your interface).
- **Medium Article**: You will need to create this article on medium.com, selecting relevant sections from the project to present in a well-organized report.

## Instructions

### 1. **Run the Colab Notebook**
   - Open the provided Colab notebook in Google Colab.
   - Follow the steps outlined in the notebook, starting from business understanding, through data understanding and preparation, to modeling and evaluation.

### 2. **Publish a Medium Article**
   - Select key sections from the output of the project to generate a concise report on Medium.
   - Explain each phase of the CRISP-DM process, such as business understanding, data cleaning, modeling, and evaluation.
   - You can enhance the article by adding images, graphs, and screenshots of results generated from the notebook or from ChatGPT.

### 3. **Export Your Work**
   - Use the **SaveGPT extension** to export the entire conversation from ChatGPT.
   - Optionally, include screenshots of the results in the Medium article for clarity (using tools like **screenshot extension**).

### 4. **Submit the Work**
   - Submit the **Medium article link** and a **PDF** version of the article to your instructor.
   - Include the **Colab notebook** and exported **chat transcript** as part of your final submission.

## Project Outline

### 1. Business Understanding
   - Define the business problem: Predict house prices based on available features.
   - Objective: Develop a predictive model and determine which features most influence house prices.

### 2. Data Understanding
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Assess data quality: Identify missing values, outliers, and data types.

### 3. Data Preparation
   - Clean the data: Handle missing values, outliers, and prepare features.
   - Feature selection: Use correlation analysis to identify the most predictive features.
   - Data preprocessing: Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.

### 4. Modeling
   - Build a baseline model (Linear Regression) and advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Compare model performance using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.
   - Evaluate feature importance for insights into key house price drivers.

### 5. Evaluation
   - Analyze model performance and interpret results.
   - Check for overfitting and refine the model if necessary.

### 6. Deployment
   - Provide recommendations based on the best-performing model.
   - Discuss future steps, such as hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
